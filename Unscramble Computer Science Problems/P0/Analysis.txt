Suppose that length of "calls" list is n and length of "texts" list is m.

Task 0:
There are 2 single implementations so the worst case Big O notation is O(2) or O(1) to be general.

Task 1:
There are 2 loops in this problem, the number of iterations for the outer loop is n + m and that of the inner loop is 2.
Therefore the worst case Big O notation is O(n + m + 2) and as an approximation it results in O(n + m).

Task 2:
The worst case scenario is that we have to look all over of the list, so time complexity is O(n).

Task 3: 
  Part A: As we can see that there are 2 loops in this algorithm, yet the length of the second loop has been 
  significantly reduced which is much smaller than the original size, so the worst case scenario is O(n).

  Part B:  Worst case is n iterations so O(n) is the time complexity.

Task 4:
In this case worst case time complexity is the sum of lengths of the four loops, and for the approximation
we conclude in O(n + m).
